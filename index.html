                Using Dairy with Road Runner 1.0
            </h1>
            <p>
                Dairy's service framework is tighly bound to the OpMode lifecycle and all services depend on <code>Loop()</code> occuring many 
                times a second. By default, Roadrunner 1.0 runs code in a blocking loop, not letting the actual <code>Loop()</code> code of your OpMode run.
                <br><br>
                For users who are not using Mercurial as a commandbase, you will only need something to correct the blocking actions runner. 
                This can be done with this sample Dairy service.
                <br><br>
                Below is a sample service called SilkRoad. It is a dairy service where you set your running actions with <code>SillRoad.runAsync()</code>, 
                similar to <code>Actions.runBlocking()</code>, but in the <code>Start()</code> method of <code>OpMode</code>. Then, SilkRoad automatically 
                updates until all supplied actions are done, with no code besides setting run async actions required.
                <br><br>
                <span id="silkroad"></span>
            <p>
                If you use Mercurial, you can also use the following wrapper
                to run your commands as if they were actions:
            </p>
                <span id="mercact"></span>
            <p>
                You cam use this in <code>SilkRoad.runAsync()</code> like you would any other action,
                but pass in a Mercurial command!
                It even works on Mercurial parallel or sequential commands by wrapping them:
                <code class="language-java">new MercurialAction(new Parallel(Command...))</code>
            </p>
            <p>
